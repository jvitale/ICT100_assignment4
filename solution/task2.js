/*
Provide the correct code for the following function safeTeleportTo.
The function takes as input parameters the robotID (a string) to teleport safely
and the tableID (a string) where the robot must teleport to.
For example, safeTeleportTo('green','table-1') must safely move
the robot green to the table one.

This function is async! This means that if you do not use await while
teleporting the robots, JavaScript will complete the call of the function
before the teleportation process is concluded.

To get the extra 0.5 marks you must reach at least a 60% success rate
and correctly use a try-catch-finally block in the safeTeleportTo function 
when acquiring and releasing the robots.

// you can also add your code here if you need to do so

async function safeTeleportTo(robotID, tableID){
    // your code goes here
