/*
Provide the correct code for the following function robotChef.
The function does not take any input parameter and it is
invoked once at the beginning of the simulation.

This function is async! This means that if you do not use await while using
async methods to control the robot chef, JavaScript will complete the call of the function
before the required actions are completed.

To get the extra 0.5 marks you must serve at least one correct order
by making a correct use of the subscribe / unsubscribe methods to
read and use all the sensors' values (temperature, clock and weight sensors).
