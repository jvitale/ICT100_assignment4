/*
This is some sample code.
You can copy and paste this code in the function safeTeleportTo() and see
what is the result.
You can re-use and adapt this code in your solution as you wish.
*/

// The function safeTeleportTo has 2 input parameters:
// robotID - a string with the id of the robot to teleport
// tableID - a string with the id of the destination table
// Let's inspect their value throughout the simulation
// by logging them on the left Log panel
// you can use the global function log
log(`This is the current robotID: ${robotID}`);
log(`And this is the current destination table: ${tableID}`);
